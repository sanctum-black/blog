Hello, & welcome!

A couple of months ago, I had an idea; to create a place where people could learn Data Science & Computer Science-related content for free by reading quality and approachable publications. This idea is far from unique; there is already a sea of infinite web pages and online courses doing an excellent job. Still, I wanted to make it unique in many ways; I wanted to make it my own and, of course, return the favour for all that I've learned over the last couple of years.

I'm Pablo, a Chemical Engineering, full-time Data Scientist and Linux & Open Source enthusiast. I'm passionate about learning things, but also about transmitting them to other people in the clearest and most rigorous way possible. This, for me, is a crucial step in owning knowledge, and is called The Feynman Technique[^1]:

- I. Study
- II. Teach
- III. Fill the Gaps
- IV. Simplify

In this Article, I'll introduce the scope of this blog, the purpose and motivations behind its inception, the added value I'm planning to provide, the overall blog structure, a more detailed explanation of what to expect from each section, and ways in which to collaborate.

I'll be using scripts which can be found in the [Blog Article Repo](https://github.com/pabloagn/blog/tree/master/learning-resources/the-motivations-behind-this-blog).

# Why learn to program?
There are multiple answers depending on who you ask, but for me, it really boils down to 3 core concepts:

## 1. It's an exciting time to learn
The last couple of years have proven to be just the beginning of a completely new way of understanding our world and creating technology to make it better; code helps us abstract complex problem into simpler ones, and solve them using what we already know.

Additionally, there has been an increasing pressure for private companies to release their code as open-source; this creates more transparency, security, and increases collaborative efforts in creating better and more secure code.

## 2. It creates a feedback loop
Learning to program does not exclusively result in learning to write code. It's just a skill as any other, and learning a new challenging skill has a wide range of side effects apart from learning the actual thing.

Our brain as we understand it, is wired by a reward system. When exposed to a rewarding stimulus, our brain's reward system responds by increasing the release of the dopamine neurotransmitter, which in turn causes pleasure.

Learning something new activates the release of dopamine, making us crave more, while at the same time providing confidence to tackle other challenging tasks. This, if managed correctly, can be sustainable and becomes into a loop of positive feedback: the more you learn, the more confident you become, and the easier it is to wake up the next morning and do the same, but better.

## 3. It provides a sense of independence
Not just because code can be written anywhere, or because programming has unlimited applications, but also because it can be learnt completely free thanks to the increasing community.

# What does it take?
There's a toxic cloud of stigma and prejudices surrounding what it takes to learn to program. People often think that programmers are born programmers, and that everyone else is canceled out of the equation by defacto; that's simply not true (*at least for 99% of the cases*), and there are millions of converted developers out there to prove it.

Apart from a computer, a power outlet, and caffeine, I believe there are 6 skills required to start coding and make it a sustainable activity:
- **Curiosity:** If there's no curiosity, it will be almost impossible to get hooked, even if the intellectual challenge is up there. This is true specially for programming because it's a vast world, and the journey never really ends, no matter how good of a programmer you are (*Wikipedia claims there are 700 + programming languages, and that's without taking into account all the frameworks, utilities, services and other technologies available*)[^2]. Still, while curiosity is a must, unmoderated curiosity will most certainly lead to oversaturation and loss of impetus; programming can become a rabbit hole if done wrong.
- **Selectivity:** It's a great thing to want to learn, but without selectivity, curiosity turns into a spiral of chaos and confusion. Having criteria as to weather what you're learning is actually valuable, is considered part of the sanity check.
- **Tolerance to frustration:** When learning to code, there can and will be multiple things that will go wrong, potentially simultaneously, and more probably when you're already having a bad day. Not sure how, but this happens more often than not. Tolerance is not just learning to endure, but also to back up, get some air, and return the next day to find out you already figured it out while in your sleep.
- **Continuity & consistency:** As with any learning activity, being constant is key. This creates familiarity between concepts; it helps us learn to connect the dots faster, and things suddenly start making a little bit more sense.
- **Modesty:** It's easy to get overconfident, specially when starting. In fact, I would say it's natural. But if programming has taught me something, is that without modesty, you'll never own your mistakes, and whenever a bug appears, you'll go into severe denial; this will make you either quit because "*the interpreter hates me and made a fowl play*", because "*if I couldn't handle this one, how am I going to keep up?*"
- **Managing expectations:** This one is closely related to the latter; if the expectations are too high, you will feel pressured to keep up and start comparing with other people, you will loose confidence, abuse coffee, and eventually enter in kernel panic. If the expectations are too low, then you might always feel you're doing perfectly fine, except when that technical interview comes, and well, you know the rest of the story; coding needs to push the boundaries of what we think we are capable of, while at the same time knowing we are potentially capable of doing it.

# A Journey Through Data Science: A space where currents converge
Programming is not just about programming; it's really more about curiosity and becoming obsessed with something so badly, you cannot let go; tricking your reward system into a feedback loop. **A Journey Through Data Science** was created as an enabler for that feedback loop to happen.

## 1. On the scope
The blog is mainly about Data Science and Computer Science-related topics with a hands-on, business approach, but covers whatever life throws in my path; this curiosity thing I mentioned, it's genuine. I like to research on new languages and technologies, adopt them, crack them and write about them if I think they provide value.

## 2. On the Technologies
I'll mostly be covering the following languages:

- Python
What is it?: Python is a...
Why learn it?: 

##### **Code**
```Python
import string

def decodeString(**kwargs):
    '''
    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwargs : list, list
        An encrypted message.
        A list of uppercase alphabet letters.

    Returns
    -------
    decoded : string
        A decoded message.
    '''
    
    decoded = ''.join([my_alphabet[x] if x >=0 else ' ' for x in my_list])
    
    print(decoded)
    
    return decoded

# Declare message and alphabet
my_list = [0, -1,
           9, 14, 20, 17, 13, 4, 24, -1,
           19, 7, 17, 14, 20, 6, 7, -1,
           3, 0, 19, 0, -1,
           18, 2, 8, 4, 13, 2, 4]

my_alphabet = list(string.ascii_uppercase)

decodeString()
```

##### **Output**
```
A JOURNEY THROUGH DATA SCIENCE
```

- Julia
What is it?: Julia is a...
Why learn it?: 

##### **Code**
```Julia
function decodeString(my_arr, my_alphabet)
    #=
    Parameters
    ----------
    my_arr : array
        An encrypted message.

    my_alphabet : vector
        Uppercase letters of the alphabet

    Returns
    -------
    decoded : string
        A decoded message.
    =#
    
    decoded = join([if x ≥ 0 my_alphabet[x+1] else ' ' end for x in my_arr])
    
    println(decoded)
    
    return decoded

end

# Declare message and alphabet
my_arr = [0 -1 [
         9] 14 20 17 13 4 24 -1 [
         19] 7 17 14 20 6 7 -1 [
         3] 0 19 0 -1 [
         18] 2 8 4 13 2 4]

my_alphabet = collect('A':'Z')

decodeString(my_arr, my_alphabet)
```

##### **Output**
```
A JOURNEY THROUGH DATA SCIENCE
```

- R

Why learn it?: 

##### **Code**
```R
library(comprehenr)

decodeString <- function(my_list, my_alphabet) {

  paste(
    to_list(
      for(x in my_list) ifelse(x >= 0, my_alphabet[x+1], ' ')
      ),
    collapse = '')

}

my_list = list(0, -1,
           9, 14, 20, 17, 13, 4, 24, -1,
           19, 7, 17, 14, 20, 6, 7, -1,
           3, 0, 19, 0, -1,

```

- LaTeX
What is it?: LaTeX is not a language per se, but a software system for document preparation, using the TeX typesetting system.
Why learn it?: 

##### **Code**
```LaTeX
```

##### **Output**


And also the following languages:
- **DAX:** The functional programming language that everybody loves (*nobody said ever*). This one is a headache, but extremely useful when working with Data Analysis since, along with Power Query M, constitutes the basis of PowerBI calculations.
- **Scala:** A highly scalable language, useful for building fault-tolerant, highly concurrent systems, and an ideal companion when supported by tools like Apache Spark.
- **Rust:** The most loved language for several consecutive years now. It's used for software applications such as game engines, operating systems, file systems, browser components, simulation engines for virtual reality, and of course, Machine Learning. I'm a total baby on this one, but we will crack it open, eventually. 
- **C++:** The defacto language for high-performance. I'm also just starting to learn C++, and hope it will provide for very cool guided projects.

Additionally, we'll be working mostly on the following IDEs and environments:

- VS Code
- JupyterLab
- Pluto
- Spyder
- RStudio
- IntelliJ Idea

We'll also be using additional technologies:
- GitHub & GitHub Gists
- WinSCP
- DBeaver
- Obsidian
- CodePen
- Datapane
- PowerBI
- Texmaker

# The Motivations: Winds are changing
For better or for worse, things are changing fast; open-source is getting an insane amount of traction, ultra high-performance languages are being cooked, obsolete social media platforms are being left behind, targeted add companies are shooting themselves in the foot, and the list goes on and on; everything is being laid out for what seems to be a very interesting series of years ahead. Technology is becoming demonopolized, democratized, and fully accessible to the public, and with that, come advantages, but also responsibilities.

## 1. On the lack of rigorous mathematical knowledge
Machine Learning is an exciting discipline that years ago was reserved to academics in research environments. Now, thanks to fantastic libraries and frameworks, it has become accessible to the public. This is a huge breakthrough no doubt, but it also has its drawbacks.

Because of the increase in ML popularity, accessibility, and all the cool stuff that has been achieved with Machine Learning, there's the huge misconception that ML is the solution to every problem; someone once told me that "*the simpler solution is almost always the best solution*", and I've come to realize this is especially important to remember in an era where overcomplication and sophistication appear to be the rule of thumb.

There's a generalized rush to learn ML concepts as fast as possible; watching as many tutorials on `scikit-learn` & `TensorFlow` as possible, reading volumes of Medium articles on how to fine tune hyperparameters and perform feature engineering, asking the same "*is this approach convenient, and why*" Stack Overflow question on 10 different threads, and in the end, deploying a solution based on the 100 iterations of a Miss. Kate Connolly surviving the Titanic crash while realizing that an ML model is actually a terrible idea for the target problem and that it could be solved with a simpler approach, sounds too familiar.

This recipe-style approach has become far too common, and I strongly believe that mathematical theory should be a key part of ML adoption. Otherwise, who becomes responsible for fine-tuning the racist ML chatbot that John, the intern, deployed? Not Miss. Kate Connolly I suppose.

## 2. On free education
I've always been passionate about open-source technologies and non-profit learning resources. I learned to program for free, and strongly believe it had a lot to do with what I've achieved so far.

## 3. On cutting-edge technologies
As the current count of programming languages surpasses..., the question truly becomes, what to learn?



## 5. On sustainable & green code
As ML technologies take a place in this new way of solving problems, energy consumption also skyrockets. Running more robust algorithms. This is entirely new to me, and I intend to always look for green approaches.

## 6. On returning the favor
I remember very well the first script I wrote some years back. I also remember that without the help of that vibrant university colleague of mine who introduced me to this rabbit hole, I would not have been able to do it. My preconception of Linux was that of an obscure technology used exclusively by Mr. Elliot Alderson to cause mayhem inside EvilCorp. Then, I realized most servers out there run on Linux systems, and yes, Kali Linux does actually exist.

Help can arrive in the form of a colleague, a YouTube Channel, or a passive-aggressive Stack Overflow moderator. It really makes no difference; what really matters is that help is out there, one ChatGPT query away.

# The Boat: Traversing through a sea of infinitude
Why create a new blog when there are already so many free resources available?

The idea is to leverage two main concepts:
- **The Feynman Technique:** By helping others learn to code resulting in knowledge ownership, making this a win-win approach.
- **Provide added value:** By making this a responsive, structured, well-organized, distraction-free and minimalist Blog without adds, sponsorships, annoying cookies or referral fees, while keeping the entire source code open, and providing a business-oriented approach whenever possible.
