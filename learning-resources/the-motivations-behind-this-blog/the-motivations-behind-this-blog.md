Hello, & welcome!

A couple of months ago, I had an idea; to create a place where people could learn Data Science & Computer Science-related content for free by reading quality and approachable publications. This idea is far from unique; there is already a sea of infinite web pages and online courses doing an excellent job. Still, I wanted to make it unique in many ways; I wanted to make it my own and, of course, return the favour for all that I've learned over the last couple of years.

I'm Pablo, a Chemical Engineering, full-time Data Scientist and Linux & Open Source enthusiast. I'm passionate about learning things, but also about transmitting them to other people in the clearest and most rigorous way possible. This, for me, is a crucial step in owning knowledge, and is called The Feynman Technique[^1]:

- Step One: Study
- Step Two: Teach
- Step Three: Fill the Gaps
- Step Four: Simplify

In this Article, I'll introduce the scope of this blog, the purpose and motivations behind its inception, the added value I'm planning to provide, the overall blog structure, a more detailed explanation of what to expect from each section, and ways in which to collaborate.

I'll be using Python scripts which can be found in the [Blog Article Repo](https://github.com/pabloagn/blog/tree/master/learning-resources/the-motivations-behind-this-blog).

# A Journey Through Data Science: A space where currents converge
**A Journey Through Data Science** is not just about Data Science, nor about programming; it's really more about curiosity, and becoming obsessed with something so badly, you cannot let go. Let me elaborate.

## 1. On the scope
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.


---

# The Motivations: Winds are changing

## 1. On free education


## 2. On the lack of rigorous mathematical knowledge


## 3. On bleeding edge technologies


## 4. On quality vs quantity


## 5. On sustainable & green code


## 6. On returning the favor
We are in this together. As I type every word, I learn along with you. I feel the frustration and suffocation but also the ardent desire to write better code. There is a certain stigma when talking about programming, and to be honest, it can be discouraging. I've been there, and still am.

Continuity to everything we do.

# The Boat: Traversing through a sea of infinitude
Why would I dedicate time to create a blog, when we already have so many resources available?
## 1. On minimal approaches


## 2. On publicity , sponsorships & referral fees 
I don't and will not receive any type of publicity in the future. This Blog is entirely free of all that.

## 3. On cookies & tracking


## 4. On open source code
All code written on this Blog is and will be open-source.

## 5. On business-oriented approaches & solving real-world problems

# The Cabins: A place to unwind
Programming requires staring at a computer screen for the most part of the day. It can become very tedious, very quickly, and in my experience, this drastically decreases motivation and productivity. This is why I designed each section as clean as possible:
- No adds, no popups, no distractions.
- Legible & simple.
- Structured & well organized.
- Responsive.

## 1. On the structure
This website is divided into 5 main pillars:
- [Blog](https://pabloagn.com/blog/): Technical articles or essays, and can be single or serialized.
- [Deep Dives](https://pabloagn.com/deep-dives/): Specialized articles exploring modules, libraries, extensions and plugins in detail.
- [Guided Projects](https://pabloagn.com/guided-projects/): Hands-on, step-by-step projects containing difficulty level & suggested prerequisites.
- [Portfolio](https://pabloagn.com/portfolio/): Single or collaborative projects containing author, date started & completed, current status, version & license.
- [Documentation](https://pabloagn.com/documentation/): Markdown documents for programming languages & technologies.

Each article contains:
- One associated category.
- One or more associated technologies.
- Created & updated timestamps.
- Approximate reading time.
- A comprehensive index.
- A code-output structure.
- Syntax-highlighted codeblocks displaying the programming language used, with the capacity to copy and paste code.
- LaTeX expressions rendered as `.svg` objects.
- Article PDF download links.
- Embed responsive objects such as Gists, Datapanes, and more to support content.
- Dark mode toggle (*only supported in the desktop version*).
- GitHub repository links for quick access.

Each GitHub repository contains:
- The article's Markdown source code, including all LaTeX expressions if applicable.
- The article's PDF document.
- The source code for all scripts used.
- Plots, charts and other visual objects supporting the article.

# The Lighthouse: How to get involved?

## 1. Contact me
You can reach out at any time by heading to my website's [Contact form](https://pabloagn.com/contact/) and saying hi. I'm currently based in Mexico City, so kindly expect a delay if you're on a different time zone.

## 2. Forking & making pull requests
All the code I write is open source; you're free to fork and create pull request for any GitHub repository. I will be sure to review your commits and merge them if they add value to the project.

## 3. Becoming a Patreon
I intend to keep this space free of any publicity or referral program. I believe that monetary contributions should be voluntary and based exclusively on each one's decision.

This is why I've set up a Patron account; it will allow me to maintain this blog's associated costs without having to incur in other monetization techniques.

It will also serve as motivation for publications; the current compromise is one article per week.

### 3.1 How Patron works?
Patreon for *A Journey Through Data Science* has 3 tiers:
- Enthusiast
- Inquisitive Programmer
- Mentee

If you're interested in becoming a Patreon, you can head to the [Membership](https://www.patreon.com/AJourneyThroughDataScience/membership) section, where you'll be presented with the three options. Just select the one that suits you best.

### 3.2 Enthusiast
Support the creation of technical, bleeding-edge, rigorous & high-quality weekly Data Science content, and get access to discussions in the official Discord Server.

### 3.3 Inquisitive Programmer
Go the extra mile and learn the nuts and bolts of Data Science.

Provide support for high-quality content creation, get bonus material every month, early access to article drafts, and access to a private channel in the official Discord Server.

### 3.4 Mentee
Receive guidance for your next project, orientation for working in the industry, deciding which branch of Data Science is right for you, creating your portfolio, or even debugging some code.

Get everything from **Inquisitive Programmer**, plus: Access to the Patron's community, exclusive voting power & personalized requests, personalized 1-on-1s for any Data Science-related task you plan to tackle next, and access to a private channel in the official Discord Server.
